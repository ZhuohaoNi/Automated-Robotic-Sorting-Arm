## Motivation and Objectives
The project is inspired by the idea of creating an AI assistant akin to Jarvis from Iron Man, along with leveraging the capabilities of modern AI technologies. The key objectives include developing a reliable object detection algorithm, integrating it with the robotic arm, and designing a user-friendly interface for system control.

## Open-ended Aspects
- **Voice Control**: Exploration of voice control for enhanced user interaction.
- **Object Detection Optimization**: Expansion of object detection and sorting capabilities.
- **Sensor and Actuator Selection**: Exploration of better sensors and actuators for enhanced functionality and precision.
